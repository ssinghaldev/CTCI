1.1 IsUnique
  - Not coding
  - Can be solved using hash-tables
  - without using hash-tables, one can do it in O(n^2)
  - without using hash-tables, one can do it in O(nlgn) after sorting

1.2 Check Permutation
  - Not coding
  - maintain 2 hashes for 2 strings which has count of words
  - go over one hash, decrease the count in other. If 0 remove
  - see other is empty
  - little bit more efficient, one can have only one hash and do the same
 
1.3 URlify
  - Go from the back and place the chars
  - when encountered ' ', insert required chars

1.4 Palindrome Permutation
  - Count char count
  - if num odd char > 1, its not a palindrome

1.5 One Away
  - Done coding
  - two different cases, same len, different len
